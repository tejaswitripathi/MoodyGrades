# MoodyGrades

Performed an analysis in RStudio on grade distribution based on student score, attendance, and location inside the lecture hall. Modeled a correlation showing that low-scoring passing students are more likely to be sitting closer to the front of the lecture hall than in the back. Reported section and row as hidden determining factor to final grade.
